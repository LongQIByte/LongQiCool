# X-Vectors vs I-Vectors: 说话人识别技术对比

## Abstract

embedding model vs i-verctors

the primary quesion of embedding methods is the lack of training dataset.

## Introduction

represation learning

universal background model(ubm)

i-verctor can be a local mothod that need different people talks the same word or sentence and then training these datas and according it to judge.
maybe, x-verctor can not all dependence a word or a sentence.

## Speaker Recognition Systems

the basic knowledge of i-verctor:

- a frame length is 25ms
- a liding windows is 3 seconds, meanwhile its feature is the mean of all frame.
